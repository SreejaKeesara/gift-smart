Facial Analysis Driven Spotify Playlist Recommender
What we are trying to do is to make a music playlist recommender based on users’ emotions. We propose a web application that user can upload pictures of people’s faces, and the Face++ API will analyze the expression and send the resulted mood to Spotify API, and it will finally show a playlist designed for this user’s mood. We think this is a new and fun way to find a music playlist since we are tired of always listening to top hits music or those by singers we like. This web application will use database to store users information, such as names, history moods, artists, etc. The two APIs the web app uses are Face++ API and Spotify API. And the web app will use a third-party authentication- the users need to login with their Facebook. If someone doesn’t have a Facebook account, he is required to create his profile and we will store it in our database.
